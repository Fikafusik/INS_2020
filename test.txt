Knives Out is an incredibly complex whodunit that skillfully subverts expectations, switches between multiple genres easily and effectively and only gets better with multiple viewings. It's also surprisingly extremely funny and expertly paced. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic.
